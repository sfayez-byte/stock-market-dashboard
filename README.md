# Market Pulse — Live Stock Market Dashboard

This is a Data Analyst Practical Assessment which requires building 
a live financial dashboard, so I chose to build a dashboard that 
describes real-time stock performance, sector allocation, volume 
trends, and key market indicators.

**Built with:** Python | yfinance | Google Sheets | Tableau Public
