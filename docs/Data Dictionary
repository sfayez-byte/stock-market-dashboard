## 💬 Personal Reflection

This project was built as a junior DA assessment — but it became something more than that.

Going in with almost no Tableau experience, the real challenge wasn't the tools. It was learning to think like an analyst: questioning the data before trusting it, understanding why a chart looks wrong before fixing it, and knowing the difference between a number that's technically correct and one that actually tells a story.

The biggest lesson wasn't technical. It was this — **when you commit fully to something and give it the right time and focus, the growth compounds fast.** What felt impossible on day one became natural by day two.

This was only my second time using Tableau. By the end I had built a multi-page live dashboard with KPI tiles, calculated fields, navigation, and a real ETL pipeline. That didn't happen by accident — it happened because the work was taken seriously.

Data analysis is not just about tools. It's about curiosity, patience, and the willingness to debug the same problem ten different ways until it works.
